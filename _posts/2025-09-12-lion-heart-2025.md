Training camp and Lion Heart 2025

## 🏖 The Ultimate Vacation

I usually end up on those vacations where all you do is eat (or eat _and_ drink) nonstop — and halfway through, you start feeling like this isn’t really rest at all. **NOT this time.**

Last-minute and completely unplanned (at least in my head), a training camp kicked in. The sweat, the tiredness, and crashing into deep sleep after each activity made it the perfect combination of vacation and staying in shape.

It was engaging enough to completely switch off from work, side projects, and other nagging thoughts.

So thank you, **Viktor** and **Ivan** — it was fun and, strangely enough, relaxing. Looking forward to the next camp!

## 🏆 The Only and the Best – _The Team_

**Viktor Tankov** – the ultimate coach, 100% dedication, and the man with the legendary Chinese stool threat

**Ivan** – soulmate and partner in our grueling trainings, AYRAN + Sponser competition enjoyer 🧋

**Vladi** – ultra competitions conqueror, a.k.a. the pork-stick destroyer and transition master

**Ivo** – IM finisher, relentless hunter trying to frag me (and as my mom says, _shallow waters are the most dangerous_)

**Ilian** – HYROX and trail running athlete, Decathlon nutrition guru

**Estie** – IM finisher, tough pancake-free athlete, 21k conqueror

**Parents** – top-tier support crew

**Me** – nutrition and gel freak, lemur-look pre-swim and loris-look post-swim, overhype expert

----------

## 🚀 The Race

It started off a bit disastrously — I arrived at the camp on time but didn’t have enough time to properly set up and load my GPS (which threw off my eating and hydration). I also got behind on my warm-up since shaking supplements turned out to be much slower than I expected 🥲

----------

### 🌊 The Swim

Skipped the chaotic mass start but immediately got caught in a backflow that dragged us out of the sea… Next year, I’d rather take the slaps than fight the current.

Nobody knows exactly what happened in the water, but one thing’s for sure — it was not cool looking at my watch and seeing 47 minutes halfway through the second lap (2.3 km of 3 km).

Getting out of the water wasn’t very pleasant either, but knowing the bike leg was next helped me calm down a bit.

----------

### 🚴 The Bike

The first 50 km were all about **PUSH, PUSH, PUSH**. Once the climbs started, I eased off slightly but still tried to keep a high tempo.

After the third climb at 75 km, the pace dipped, but I kept my cadence high to save my legs for the run. After the final climb — _Dushevatka_ — I hit the flat road and emptied the tank over the next few kilometers.

----------

### 🏃 The Run

Focused on keeping a steady pace, I started slightly slower, crushed the descents, and power-hiked the ascents — using different muscle groups on the uphills and downhills. I pushed hard on the road descents while staying stable, but the real highlight came earlier: overtaking a competitor in my age group (not realizing he was in 3rd place) gave me a boost, especially since he had passed me on the bike during the third climb.

On the climb and descent toward the Hero Monument, after seeing with the two machines — Ivan and Ivo — I shifted into the next gear for the push to the Lion Head, keeping my pulse in the 160s. On the descent, it jumped to 170 bpm as I tried to keep a high cadence with shorter steps.

Once I hit the road, it was time to empty the tank — overtaking two ultra competitors ahead of me and finishing with a final sprint.

**Huge thanks to my parents** for their next-level cheering, as always!
