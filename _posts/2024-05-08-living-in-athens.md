Life in Athens is an adventure of its own - full with a lot of experiences, delicious food and a few challenges along the way.

All museums are free for visitors under 25 — a great perk if you love culture and history!

## The Fun Stuff 🌞
Athens has plenty to offer beyond its iconic ruins:
- **Thriving Digital Nomad Scene:** The city hosts one of the largest digital nomad communities from the Balkans, making it easy to find like-minded people.
- **Sightseeing & History Everywhere:** You’re practically living in an open-air museum.
- **Beach Days & Sailing:** The Aegean Sea is right there — perfect for weekend escapes.
- **Friendly, Helpful Locals:** Most Athenians are open-minded and speak fluent English, which makes daily life much easier.
- **Local Markets & Food:** Flea and street markets (“Laiki”) pop up every few days. Fresh fish and meat from Omonia’s shops are a must.
- **Amazing Cuisine:** Greek food is everything you’d expect — fresh, flavorful, and soul-satisfying.

I’d say the most popular online shopping platform in Greece — similar to Amazon in the US or eBay in parts of Western Europe — is [skroutz.gr](https://skroutz.gr).

## The Not-So-Fun Stuff 😿

Of course, not everything is sunshine, ouzo and souvlaki:

-   **Blazing Hot Summers:** Prepare to sweat — a lot.
-   **Internet HELL:** Some neighborhoods (including Agia Panteleimonas, where I stayed) have frustratingly poor internet service.
-   **Bureaucracy:** Mandatory paperwork can be painfully slow and confusing.
-   **Public Transport:** Let’s just say it’s not the city’s strongest feature.
-   **Strange Encounters:** Certain central areas have their share of “NPC vibes”.

## Must-Visit Places

Here are my highlights:

-   **Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center (SNFCC):** The national library is my absolute favorite spot in Athens. It’s a stunning, modern building full of students — the atmosphere is inspiring and perfect for learning.
-   **Mount Parnitha by Cable Car:** A winter surprise! The mountain gets plenty of snow and offers cozy huts serving great pasta.
-   **Nearby Islands:** Skip the overhyped Santorini and head to Salamina, Agistri, or Poros. They’re colorful, affordable, and reachable by a quick ferry ride from Piraeus.
-   **Chamolia Fish Tavern:** [Located](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?lat=37.920876&lon=24.027695&zoom=18#map=18/37.920878/24.027695&layers=CN) about 60 km from Athens — hands down one of the best places for seafood (thanks to Dora for the recommendation!).
-   **The 7 Ancient Monuments of Athens:** Of course, the Parthenon is a must-see, along with the other iconic landmarks scattered across the city.

## Cost of Living (2024) 💸

Here’s what you can expect if you plan to stay long-term:

-   **Groceries:** Fair prices overall; fresh fish is especially affordable.
-   **Housing:** €350–€500 for a room in a fully furnished apartment. (Check [spitogatos.gr](https://spitogatos.gr) or [xe.gr](https://xe.gr)).
-   **Utility Bills:** €90-€130 per person including electricity, water and heating at the winter. 

Just a heads-up — electricity bills are issued quarterly (every 3 months).

-   **Medical Services:** €50 per GP or dentist visit, or free if you’re patient enough to navigate the public health system.
-   **Public Transport:** €27 per month (airport rides not included). The transportation is mehh.
-   **Eating Out:** Around €30–€40 for a salad, main dish, and dessert.
-   **Entertainment:** €50–€100 depending on your activity (surfing, fishing, clubbing, etc.).
-   **Cabs:** Reasonably priced when needed — though I try to avoid them.

## The IT Scene

If you’re planning to work in tech while in Athens, here’s the reality:
-   **Greek Companies:** Often hesitant to hire non-Greek speakers. Landing a job can be tough.
-   **Remote Work:** Still not widely adopted among local companies.
-   **Education Requirements:** A university degree is almost always expected.

## Summary

Everything I’ve shared here comes from my 9 months of living in Athens, Greece. During that time, I learned a lot, leveled up my survival skills, and met some truly amazing people — some of whom I now work with professionally, and others who have become very close friends (shoutout to Chief Fafa — the best!).

I eventually moved back to my home country, Bulgaria, for many reasons. The biggest ones were that the overall level of development of Greece isn’t drastically different, I wanted to be closer to family and friends, and I found the professional scene in Greece to be less promising than in Bulgaria (at least in late 2023 and early 2024).

Still, Athens holds a special place in me, and I’ll definitely keep returning — whether for vacations or to reconnect with the  people I met there.
